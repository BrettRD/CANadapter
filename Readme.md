# CANadapter

This is a basic CAN bus adapter based on the MCP2515 and the MCP2551.
The design is largely compatible with the Sparkfun CAN-BUS Shield for the sake of everyone's sanity.

The connectors are intended to be pin-compatible with Pmod, but there doesn't seen to be a standard or even defacto pinout for CANbus on Pmod online.
